**Solution:**

Here is one possible solution (there are multiple solutions to this puzzle). 
To draw the line, start from '0' and follow the sequence of integers.
The 'X' represents the obstacles.

16, 17, 'X', 21, 22, 23  
15, 18, 19, 20, 'X', 24  
14, 11, 10, 9, 8, 25  
13, 12, 'X', 'X', 7, 26  
'X', 1, 0, 'X', 6, 'X'  
'X', 2, 3, 4, 5, 'X'
